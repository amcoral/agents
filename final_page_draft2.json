      "heading": "Ideas and contributions",
      "wikitext": "Patel's published work has focused on systemic risk and transition in the international order, with particular emphasis on the interaction of geopolitics, technology and capital allocation.\n\n===Great-power transitions and the international order===\nIn a peer-reviewed article in ''Frontiers in Political Science'', Patel and co-authors argued that major powers tend to pass through identifiable life-cycle phases and assessed implications for U.S. strategic positioning and alliance structures.<ref name=\"R174\" />\n\nIn a 2023 lecture hosted in the Lord Mayor's \"Knowledge Miles\" series at Gresham College, Patel framed the early 21st century as a period of overlapping transitions\u2014including demographic growth, a shift toward multipolarity, and changes in technology and labor markets\u2014and argued that these shifts would affect trade, capital, population, information and energy flows.<ref name=\"R186\" />\n\nIn a panel discussion hosted by the World Academy of Art and Science, Patel described contemporary \"global turbulence\" in terms of multiple long-run \"cycles\" operating simultaneously, including climate cycles, shifts in economic eras (from industrial to information/technology), and changes in global power structures.<ref name=\"R189\" />\n\nIn a 2020 SALT interview series hosted by SALT, Patel argued that historical empires tend to follow recurring rise-and-fall patterns and discussed the possibility of the United States moving from a period of predominance toward a shared-power system. In the same interview, he described what he called a \"quadrilateral\" structure of major power blocs\u2014framed around the United States, China, India and the European Union\u2014and argued that their interaction would increasingly shape global trade and rules-setting.<ref name=\"R194\" />\n\nIn a panel discussion on investment opportunities along the \"New Silk Road\", Patel characterized the initiative as linking Europe and Asia through both physical and digital infrastructure and argued that investors assess countries across the corridor according to factors including the enforceability of law, currency convertibility, and sectoral regulatory ground rules.<ref name=\"R195\" />\n\n===Sustainable development finance and capital allocation===\nIn ''Cadmus'', Patel and co-authors argued that meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is constrained less by the absolute availability of capital than by capital allocation mechanisms, incentives and risk pricing.<ref name=\"R161\" /> Stefan Brunnhuber later described the paper as a \"seminal\" and \"highly novel\" contribution in an article responding to it.<ref name=\"R184\" />\n\nIn a 2022 keynote address at an \"SDG Investment Fair\", Patel argued that SDG-related projects are often treated as \"worthy causes\" rather than commercial opportunities, and that investor concerns (including currency, regulatory, execution, exit and ESG-related risks) can raise required returns and limit capital flows to lower-income countries.<ref name=\"R187\" />\n\nIn a panel discussion on sustainability performance and metrics, Patel argued that global investable capital exists but is not structured to flow to areas of greatest need, and that risk\u2013return incentives tend to steer investment toward established markets rather than lower-income countries. In the same discussion, he said his analysis at Force for Good includes the geography and sectoral distribution of SDG-related finance and argued that technology solutions are being developed and deployed unevenly, with lower adoption in parts of the Global South.<ref name=\"RBJOuimJlSs4\" />\n\nIn a panel at SALT on sustainability and capital allocation, Patel framed SDG financing as partly an investment opportunity tied to the inclusion of underserved populations and argued that technology can lower the cost of serving those markets.<ref name=\"R196\" />\n\nIn a panel discussion on financing implementation of the SDGs hosted by the World Academy of Art and Science as part of its \"Global Leadership for the 21st Century\" series, Patel argued that there is no \"lack of money\" globally, but that financing depends on regulation and incentives, standard-setting to reduce \"SDG-washing\", and innovation in instruments (including debt-related tools).<ref name=\"RvdNREXocbJs\" />\n\nIn an ICSD 2022 plenary session on financing implementation of the SDGs and the European Green Deal, Patel said his analysis at Force for Good suggested SDG financing requirements and the SDG financing gap had increased compared with earlier estimates, and argued that capital-allocation changes would require alignment among households, governments, the financial sector and corporations. He also said Force for Good's research found an association between more extensive sustainability activity and higher shareholder returns (as presented in the session).<ref name=\"Ro4g_83HuXJ0\" />\n\n===Energy transition, externalities and future energy systems===\nIn a COP29-related interview clip published by Force for Good, Patel argued that current accounting and market pricing does not fully incorporate environmental externalities, and suggested that regulators determine rules for pricing such costs.<ref name=\"R188\" /> In the same interview, he described fossil fuels as having enabled industrial prosperity but argued that an immediate shut-off would be destabilizing, and said he expected a further breakthrough toward a clean and abundant energy source within \"the next decade\" or \"decade and a half\".<ref name=\"R188\" />\n\nIn a COP29 dialogue session on innovation for climate and sustainability action, Patel discussed the role of incentives in capital allocation and, using India as an example, argued that investors see the country as having underlying macroeconomic \"drivers\" including urbanization, changing income distribution, and increasing internet use (as stated in the discussion).<ref name=\"IzWgfBIiaZ4\" /> In the same panel, he argued that investor returns in India have been difficult to achieve consistently because, in his view, the pool of managers with differentiated capabilities is relatively limited and market volatility can be high; he said that protecting capital and managing risk were important factors for limited partners selecting managers (as stated in the discussion).<ref name=\"IzWgfBIiaZ4\" />\n\nIn a COP29 dialogue session on innovation for climate and sustainability action, Patel argued that climate policy faced constraints in public and electoral politics and said that, in his reading of the IPCC reports, existing policies did not put the world on track to limit warming to 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C. In the same discussion, he said the financial system was structured to serve only part of the global population and argued that investment into lower-income markets is constrained by investor assessments of regulatory stability, currency controls, and exit/liquidity conditions (as stated in the session).<ref name=\"Rezd cZ5AsFdc\" />\n\n===Artificial intelligence and investment===\nIn a 2023 panel discussion about whether investment in AI resembled a bubble, Patel argued that AI was \"foundational\" rather than a short-term bubble, and described the technology as a hybrid of human and machine capabilities (which he termed \"augmented\" intelligence rather than \"artificial\" intelligence).<ref name=\"RSLzI6WBvUnw\" /> In the same discussion, he argued that current AI systems were better described as tools for searching and structuring information than as systems with human-like contextual understanding or emotion, while also describing the technology as economically transformative and widely applicable across sectors including healthcare, education, financial services and research (as stated in the panel).<ref name=\"RSLzI6WBvUnw\" />\n\n===Global turbulence and polycrisis frameworks===\nIn 2025, Patel co-authored a series of ''Cadmus'' articles proposing conceptual frameworks for understanding \"global turbulence\" and policy responses to interlinked crises across security, development and governance.<ref name=\"R176\" /><ref name=\"R175\" />\n\n===Cognitive sovereignty and information-era security===\nA 2025 SSRN preprint by Patel examined what it termed \"cognitive empires\" and the strategic implications of algorithmic influence and AI systems for autonomy and security.<ref name=\"R177\" />\n\n===Technology and development pathways===\nIn Force for Good reports, Patel and collaborators have argued that digital technologies could materially accelerate progress toward sustainable development targets when paired with governance and investment frameworks.<ref name=\"R179\" /><ref name=\"R180\" />\n\nIn a panel on global trade and investment \"megatrends\", Patel argued that recent shocks had reduced the usefulness of extrapolating past trends in planning, and that large, apparently isolated events could substantially reshape capital flows and priorities, including financing for the SDGs.<ref name=\"R191\" />\n\nIn a 2023 conference session on \"education for human security\" (World Academy of Art and Science), Patel presented the Human Security for All campaign as an attempt to translate the UN Sustainable Development Goals into a more accessible framework. He described the campaign in terms of seven \"pillars\"\u2014food security, healthcare, economic security, environmental protection, personal safety and mobility, community security, and political freedom\u2014and argued that a simpler framing could help technology firms and other organizations connect their activities to human-security outcomes.<ref name=\"RAM4p8kAazg8\" />\n\nIn the same session, Patel argued that technology could help expand access to education and other services, and said that \"40\" SDG targets could be addressed through technology transfer; he cited UNICEF work on providing internet-like access to education in remote areas as an example of implementation approaches discussed in the session.<ref name=\"RAM4p8kAazg8\" />\n\nIn a separate talk on the \"future of money\", Patel argued that the \"character\" of capital depends on its sources and associated obligations, and that the digitization of finance can disintermediate traditional institutions and enable more peer-to-peer transactions. He also argued that political debates framed as \"socialism\" versus \"capitalism\" were less descriptive of how money functions in an information-era context, and described digitization as expanding the range of assets and services that can be monetized and traded.<ref name=\"RfsbiQ5Y9j2E\" />\n\nIn a 2025 CES panel discussion on technology and the developing world, Patel argued that falling technology costs and profit incentives would push firms toward \"new markets\" and \"new customers\", and that policy and cultural context can affect adoption. In the same discussion, he cited India's digital identity-linked system as an example of technology-enabled financial inclusion, describing it as enabling hundreds of millions of people to open bank accounts over several years (as stated in the panel).<ref name=\"R4sXj29SkAA8\" />\n\nIn a 2025 CES interview focused on Force for Good's technology report, Patel described what he called a \"fierce competition\" among states in technology development, arguing that leadership in key technologies tends to correlate with geopolitical influence. In the same interview, he said Force for Good's research identified \"19 technologies\" that were ready to deploy and argued that practical barriers\u2014including market size, governance, regulatory constraints for investors, and currency convertibility\u2014can slow adoption in lower-income markets.<ref name=\"R193\" />\n\n===Risk, insurance and resilience===\nIn a recorded interview for a series on \"the future of capitalism\", Patel discussed risk and resilience with Bruce Carnegie-Brown (chairman of Lloyd's of London). In the interview, Patel raised risks associated with climate change and climate-driven migration, and argued that a substantial share of the Sustainable Development Goals financing gap could potentially be reduced through the transfer and application of existing technologies.<ref name=\"bGYwvYotujQ\" />"
