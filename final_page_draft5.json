			"heading": "Ideas and contributions",
			"wikitext": "Patel's published work has focused on great power transition, systemic risk and transition in the international order, with particular emphasis on the interaction of geopolitics, technology and capital allocation.\n\nGreat-power transitions and the international order\n\nin an examination of American Hegemony, Patel and co-authors argued that the United States in common with a history’s major powers is passing through an identifiable life-cycle phases evidencing common critical indicators of decline and assessed implications for U.S. strategic positioning and alliance structures.R174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal turbulence and polycrisis frameworks\n\nIn 2025, Patel co-authored a series of Cadmus articles proposing frameworks for understanding \"global turbulence\" and policy responses to interlinked crises across security, development and governance.R176R175\n\nCognitive sovereignty and information-era security\n\nIn a 2025 paper Patel examined what he termed \"cognitive empires\" wherein power projection shifts from a primary focus on land to minds through algorithms underlying AI-enabled systems, undermining individual agency, sovereignty and security.R177 At the AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi, Patel launched a report Technologies Shaping the Future.xxx and presented the idea of Cognitive Empires, the rivalry between the U.S. and China around six systemic technologies, and the need for Europe and India to form a third axis to maintain autonomyxxx\n\nTechnology and development pathways\n\nIn the Force for Good series of reports, Patel and collaborators identify 19 core technologies common to countries and companies competing for power and value XXX. They argue that digital technologies in particular could materially accelerate progress toward addressing development targets when paired with governance and investment frameworks.R179R180 The World Investment Plan report produced in 2025 was presented at the side event forum hosted by Pvblic at the United Nations in interim form during the United Nations General Assumbly,xxx and in final form at COP30 (citation as above).\n\nInternational capital allocation for development\n\nPatel and co-authors have argued that meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is constrained less by the absolute availability of capital than by capital allocation mechanisms, incentives and risk.R161 A paper based on the report published in Cadmus was a \"seminal\" and \"highly novel\" contribution in an article responding to it.R184 In a Reuters OpEd in [2024], Patel argued that the key to closing the worldwide development gap was scaled implementation of proven solutions not a primary focus on capital mobilisation.R188R189\n\nClimate transition policy and pathways\n\nIn a 2024 perspective paper, Patel and co-author, Hansmeyer, described five climate transition scenarios and socioeconomic pathways.R197\n\nMaster Strategy\n\nPatel’s book, The Master Strategist, was published by Random House and includes a foreword from Nelson MandelaR194R191R192. The book proposes that given systemic level changes from world events, strategies need to become systemic too.xxx"

On the same presentation, Garry Jacobs, President of the World Academy of Art and Science, agreed that “We're being manipulated .. We're being told what we want to be told” but added that AI “is a positive great opportunity”. Shaurya Doval, founder of the India Foundation, observed that “capital sovereignty” was a critical ingredient in addition to cognitive.\n\nStefan Brunnhuber described Patel and co-authors' paper on funding the SDGsxxx as \"seminal\" and \"highly novel\" in an article responding to its argument while highlighting alternative solutions.R184\n\nUNCTAD’s New York Chief, reporting on the Future Capital initiative described Patel’s work as \"unprecedented\" in defining activities that could make an entity or industry a \"force for good\" and described the project as having potential to support UN work on advancing investment in the SDGs.R196"
