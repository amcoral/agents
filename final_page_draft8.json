      "heading": "Ideas and contributions",
      "wikitext": "Patel's published work addresses systemic transition and systemic risk in the international order, with an emphasis on the interaction of geopolitics, technology and capital allocation.\n\nAt the launch of the report ''Technologies Shaping the Future'' at the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Patel said that \"geopolitics, science, technology and markets\" were underwriting a systemic transformation and that the outcome was \"not yet predetermined\".<ref name=\"R209\" />\n\n===Great-power transitions and the international order===\nPatel and co-authors argue that major powers tend to pass through identifiable life-cycle phases and assessed implications for U.S. strategic positioning and alliance structures.<ref name=\"R174\" />\n\nIn a 2023 lecture in the Lord Mayor's \"Knowledge Miles\" series at Gresham College, Patel framed the early 21st century as a period of overlapping transitions—including demographic growth, a shift toward multipolarity, and changes in technology and labour markets—and argued that these shifts would affect trade, capital, population, information and energy flows.<ref name=\"R194\" /><ref name=\"PK-qz7lQ4nQ\" />\n\nIn a World Academy of Art and Science panel discussion, Patel described contemporary \"global turbulence\" as the interaction of multiple long-run cycles, including climate cycles, shifts in economic eras and changes in global power structures.<ref name=\"MG4y2KUlclU\" />\n\nIn a 2020 ''SALT Talks'' interview, Patel argued that historical empires tend to follow recurring rise-and-fall patterns and discussed the possibility of the United States moving from a period of predominance toward a shared-power system. In the same interview, he described what he called a \"quadrilateral\" structure of major power blocs—around the United States, China, India and the European Union—and argued that their interaction would increasingly shape global trade and rules-setting.<ref name=\"UWGa70nSfcQ\" />\n\nIn a panel discussion on investment opportunities along the \"New Silk Road\", Patel characterised the initiative as linking Europe and Asia through physical and digital infrastructure and discussed investor assessments of legal enforceability, currency convertibility and sectoral regulatory frameworks.<ref name=\"Z2YsxpHQez4\" />\n\n===Sustainable development finance and capital allocation===\nPatel and co-authors argued that meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is constrained less by the absolute availability of capital than by allocation mechanisms, incentives and risk pricing. in ''Cadmus''.<ref name=\\\"R161\\\" /> Patel argued that scaling proven solutions and mobilising capital at commercial scale are central to closing SDG funding gaps.<ref name=\"R188\" />\n\nIn a 2022 keynote address at an \"SDG Investment Fair\", Patel argued that SDG-related projects are often treated as \"worthy causes\" rather than commercial opportunities, and that investor concerns (including currency, regulatory, execution, exit and ESG-related risks) can raise required returns and limit capital flows to lower-income countries.<ref name=\"nzU-2VQtfmI\" />\n\nIn a panel discussion on sustainability performance and metrics, Patel argued that global investable capital exists but is not structured to flow to areas of greatest need, and that risk–return incentives tend to steer investment toward established markets rather than lower-income countries. He also said Force for Good's analysis includes the geography and sectoral distribution of SDG-related finance and argued that technology solutions are being developed and deployed unevenly, with lower adoption in parts of the Global South.<ref name=\"BJOuimJlSs4\" />\n\nIn a SALT panel on sustainability and capital allocation, Patel framed SDG financing as partly an investment opportunity tied to the inclusion of underserved populations and argued that technology can lower the cost of serving those markets.<ref name=\"vXiOrcfPAcI\" />\n\nIn a World Academy of Art and Science panel on financing implementation of the SDGs, Patel argued that there is no global \"lack of money\" but that financing depends on regulation and incentives, standards to reduce \"SDG-washing\", and innovation in financial instruments, including debt-related tools.<ref name=\"vdNREXocbJs\" />\n\nIn an ICSD 2022 plenary session on financing implementation of the SDGs and the European Green Deal, Patel said Force for Good's analysis suggested SDG financing requirements and the financing gap had increased compared with earlier estimates and argued that capital-allocation changes would require alignment among households, governments, the financial sector and corporations. In the same session, he said Force for Good's research found an association between more extensive sustainability activity and higher shareholder returns (as presented in the session).<ref name=\"o4g_83HuXJ0\" />\n\n===Energy transition, externalities and future energy systems===\nIn a COP29-related interview, Patel argued that accounting and market pricing do not fully incorporate environmental externalities and suggested that regulators determine rules for pricing such costs. In the same interview, he said that fossil fuels enabled industrial prosperity but argued that an immediate shut-off would be destabilising; he also said he expected a further breakthrough toward a clean and abundant energy source within \"the next decade\" or \"decade and a half\".<ref name=\"sCTnMHbMlGk\" />\n\nIn a COP29 dialogue session on innovation for climate and sustainability action, Patel discussed incentives in capital allocation and, using India as an example, argued that investors see the country as having underlying macroeconomic drivers including urbanisation, changing income distribution and increasing internet use.<ref name=\"IzWgfBIiaZ4\" /> In the same session, he argued that investor returns in India have been difficult to achieve consistently because, in his view, the pool of managers with differentiated capabilities is relatively limited and market volatility can be high; he said capital protection and risk management are important factors for limited partners selecting managers.<ref name=\"IzWgfBIiaZ4\" />\n\nIn another COP29 dialogue session, Patel argued that climate policy faced constraints in public and electoral politics and said that, in his reading of IPCC reports, existing policies did not put the world on track to limit warming to 2.5 °C. In the same discussion, he said the financial system was structured to serve only part of the global population and argued that investment into lower-income markets is constrained by investor assessments of regulatory stability, currency controls, and exit and liquidity conditions.<ref name=\"ezdcZ5AsFdc\" />\n\n===Artificial intelligence and investment===\nIn a 2023 panel discussion about whether investment in AI resembled a bubble, Patel argued that AI was \"foundational\" rather than a short-term bubble and described the technology as a hybrid of human and machine capabilities (which he termed \"augmented\" intelligence rather than \"artificial\" intelligence). In the same discussion, he argued that current AI systems were better described as tools for searching and structuring information than as systems with human-like contextual understanding or emotion, while also describing the technology as economically transformative across sectors including healthcare, education, financial services and research.<ref name=\"SLzI6WBvUnw\" />\n\n===Global turbulence and polycrisis frameworks===\nIn 2025, Patel co-authored a series of ''Cadmus'' articles proposing conceptual frameworks for understanding \"global turbulence\" and policy responses to interlinked crises across security, development and governance.<ref name=\"R176\" /><ref name=\"R175\" />\n\n===Cognitive sovereignty and information-era security===\nA 2025 SSRN preprint by Patel examined what it termed \"cognitive empires\", arguing that algorithmic systems can shift power projection toward influence over attention and decision-making, with implications for individual agency, sovereignty and security.<ref name=\"R177\" />\n\n===Climate policy, COP processes and finance===\nIn ''Frontiers in Environmental Economics'', Patel and co-authors examined the economic and governance implications of the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), including what they described as gaps between stated commitments and implementation pathways.<ref name=\"R197\" />\n\n===Technology and development pathways===\nIn Force for Good reports, Patel and collaborators have argued that digital technologies could materially accelerate progress toward sustainable development targets when paired with governance and investment frameworks.<ref name=\"R179\" /><ref name=\"R180\" />\n\nIn a panel on global trade and investment \"megatrends\", Patel argued that recent shocks had reduced the usefulness of extrapolating past trends in planning and that large events could reshape capital flows and priorities, including financing for the SDGs.<ref name=\"D1FeMgmEnbY\" />\n\nIn a 2023 World Academy of Art and Science session on \"education for human security\", Patel presented the Human Security for All campaign as an attempt to translate the SDGs into a more accessible framework. He described the campaign in terms of seven \"pillars\"—food security, healthcare, economic security, environmental protection, personal safety and mobility, community security, and political freedom—and argued that the framing could help organisations connect activities to human-security outcomes.<ref name=\"AM4p8kAazg8\" />\n\nIn the same session, Patel argued that technology could help expand access to education and other services, and said that \"40\" SDG targets could be addressed through technology transfer; he cited UNICEF work on providing internet-like access to education in remote areas as an example discussed in the session.<ref name=\"AM4p8kAazg8\" />\n\nIn a separate talk on the \"future of money\", Patel argued that the \"character\" of capital depends on its sources and associated obligations and that the digitisation of finance can disintermediate traditional institutions and enable more peer-to-peer transactions. He also argued that political debates framed as \"socialism\" versus \"capitalism\" were less descriptive of how money functions in an information-era context and described digitisation as expanding the range of assets and services that can be monetised and traded.<ref name=\"fsbiQ5Y9j2E\" />\n\nIn a 2025 CES panel discussion on technology and the developing world, Patel argued that falling technology costs and profit incentives would push firms toward \"new markets\" and \"new customers\", and that policy and cultural context can affect adoption. In the same discussion, he cited India's digital identity-linked system as an example of technology-enabled financial inclusion, describing it as enabling hundreds of millions of people to open bank accounts over several years.<ref name=\"4sXj29SkAA8\" />\n\nIn a 2025 CES interview, Patel argued that competition among states in technology development was intensifying and that leadership in key technologies tends to correlate with geopolitical influence. He also said Force for Good's research identified \"19 technologies\" that were ready to deploy and argued that barriers including market size, governance, regulatory constraints for investors and currency convertibility can slow adoption in lower-income markets.<ref name=\"CU2nlM0Pyxc\" />\n\n===Risk, insurance and resilience===\nIn a recorded interview for a series on \"the future of capitalism\", Patel discussed risk and resilience with Bruce Carnegie-Brown (chairman of Lloyd's of London). In the interview, Patel raised risks associated with climate change and climate-driven migration and argued that a substantial share of the SDG financing gap could potentially be reduced through the transfer and application of existing technologies.<ref name=\"bGYwvYotujQ\" />"
