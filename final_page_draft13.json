They highlighted what they described as gaps between stated commitments and implementation pathways.<ref name=\"R197\" />\n\n===Information-era security and \"cognitive empires\"===\nA 2025 SSRN preprint by Patel set out the concept of \"cognitive empires\". It argued that algorithmic systems can shift power projection toward influence over attention and decision-making, with implications for individual agency, sovereignty and security.<ref name=\"R177\" />\n\n===Global turbulence frameworks===\nPatel co-authored a series of ''Cadmus'' articles in 2025 proposing frameworks for understanding \"global turbulence\" and policy responses to interlinked crises across security, development and governance.<ref name=\"R176\" /><ref name=\"R175\" />\n\n===Technology and development pathways===\nAcross Force for Good reports, Patel and collaborators have argued that digital technologies could materially accelerate progress toward development targets when paired with governance and investment frameworks.<ref name=\"R179\" /><ref name=\"R180\" /> In 2003, Patel discussed the convergence of mobile telephony and payments as an example of how consumer technology could reshape markets. He described mobile-based checkout payments and suggested partnerships between handset makers, network operators and card networks; he also proposed low-cost, pre-charged phones for markets with limited access to phone service. In the same interview, he argued that pharmaceutical business models were vulnerable to political and consumer pressure over drug prices and proposed a large R&D fund backed by governments and philanthropies to accelerate drug development and reduce costs.<ref name=\"R220\" />\n\nIn 2023, Patel said that India's economic trajectory and geopolitical position were reinforcing each other, stating that \"This will be India's century\".<ref name=\"R221\" /> He described India's digital identity and payments infrastructure as enabling large-scale financial inclusion and lowering transaction frictions across the economy. The reforms were associated with the opening of around half a billion bank accounts and about US$20 billion in deposits from new account holders.<ref name=\"R221\" />\n"
